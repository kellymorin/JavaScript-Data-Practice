# Working with Data
For this practice we were asked to take a raw data file found [here](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/client-side-mastery/blob/master/book-3-the-neophyte/chapters/github_data.js) and use existing knowledge of array iteration, and object property dot notation to answer the following questions.

  1. How many total commits were made in all of Steve's events?
  1. How many of each event type are there? (PullRequestEvent, PushEvent, etc)
  1. List all Github users who submitted a pull request that was approved by Steve.
  1. List all repositories on which Steve had an event, and show how many events were on each one.
  1. Which event had the most number of commits?
  1. Which programming langugages were affected by Steve's events?
  1. What programming language was the most affected by Steve's events?
